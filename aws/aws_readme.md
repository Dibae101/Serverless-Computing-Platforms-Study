### Test Scenario: Evaluating Security Configuration for AWS Lambda with API Gateway and Amazon Cognito

This test scenario evaluates the security configuration capabilities of AWS Lambda integrated with API Gateway and Amazon Cognito. The setup ensures secure authentication, authorization, data encryption, vulnerability management, and logging. Here is a short explanation of the test scenario:

#### IAM Role Configuration for Lambda
**Objective:** Assign necessary permissions to the Lambda function for execution and logging.

**Steps:**
1. Create an IAM role with policies for Lambda execution and KMS decryption.

#### Lambda Function Creation
**Objective:** Set up a Lambda function to process requests and demonstrate decryption using AWS KMS.

**Steps:**
1. Define a Lambda function with a basic handler that decrypts data encrypted using KMS.

#### API Gateway Configuration
**Objective:** Securely expose the Lambda function via a REST API.

**Steps:**
1. Create an API Gateway REST API with a resource and a GET method integrated with the Lambda function using AWS_PROXY integration.

#### Cognito User Pool Integration
**Objective:** Implement secure authentication and authorization for the API Gateway using Amazon Cognito.

**Steps:**
1. Create a Cognito user pool and a user pool client.
2. Configure API Gateway to use Cognito for authorization.

#### Data Encryption
**Objective:** Ensure data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS and data in transit is secured with TLS.

**Steps:**
1. Use a KMS key for encrypting data in the Lambda function.

#### Audit Logging and Monitoring
**Objective:** Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for security auditing and troubleshooting.

**Steps:**
1. Configure CloudWatch for logging Lambda function execution, API Gateway logs, and Cognito user pool activities.
2. Set up CloudTrail for logging API calls.
