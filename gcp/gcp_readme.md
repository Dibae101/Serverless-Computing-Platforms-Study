Test Scenario: Evaluating Security Configuration for Google Cloud Functions

This test scenario assesses the security configuration capabilities of Google Cloud Functions, focusing on secure authentication, authorization, data encryption, vulnerability management, and logging. The setup ensures that Cloud Functions are properly secured and compliant with industry standards. Here is a short explanation of the test scenario:

IAM Role Configuration for Cloud Functions

Objective: Assign necessary IAM roles to the Cloud Function for execution and logging.

Steps:

	1.	Create a service account with appropriate IAM roles for the Cloud Function, including the roles/cloudfunctions.invoker role.
	2.	Attach the service account to the Cloud Function.

Cloud Function Creation

Objective: Set up a Google Cloud Function to process HTTP requests and demonstrate secure operations.

Steps:

	1.	Define a Cloud Function with an HTTP trigger and specify the runtime environment.
	2.	Ensure the function is configured to use environment variables for sensitive data like OAuth 2.0 credentials.

OAuth 2.0 Configuration

Objective: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization.

Steps:

	1.	Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console, including setting up consent screens and redirect URIs.
	2.	Set OAuth 2.0 credentials as environment variables in the Cloud Function.

Data Encryption

Objective: Ensure data at rest is encrypted using Cloud KMS and data in transit is secured with TLS.

Steps:

	1.	Set up Cloud KMS for encrypting sensitive data used by the Cloud Function.
	2.	Obtain and apply a TLS certificate to secure data in transit.

Security Patching

Objective: Ensure the Cloud Function app is regularly updated and patched for vulnerabilities.

Steps:

	1.	Regularly update the function’s runtime and dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
	2.	Monitor for updates from Google Cloud related to runtime and dependencies.

Compliance Certifications

Objective: Align with industry compliance standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001.

Steps:

	1.	Review Google Cloud’s compliance offerings and documentation.
	2.	Implement additional controls and configurations as needed to meet specific compliance requirements.

Data Residency Controls

Objective: Ensure data residency and sovereignty by using regional deployments.

Steps:

	1.	Deploy the Cloud Function and related resources in specific regions to comply with data residency requirements.

Logging and Monitoring

Objective: Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring for security auditing and troubleshooting.

Steps:

	1.	Configure Stackdriver Logging and Monitoring for the Cloud Function.
	2.	Set up alerts for error rates and other critical metrics related to the function’s performance.
